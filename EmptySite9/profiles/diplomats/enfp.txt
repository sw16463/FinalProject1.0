The ENFP personality is a true free spirit. They are often the life of 
the party, but unlike Explorers, they are less interested in the sheer 
excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in enjoying the 
social and emotional connections they make with others. Charming, independent, 
energetic and compassionate, the 7% of the population that they 
comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd.
