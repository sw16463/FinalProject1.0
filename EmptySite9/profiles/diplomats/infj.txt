The INFJ personality type is very rare, making up less than one percent 
of the population, but they nonetheless leave their mark on the world.

 but what sets them apart is the accompanying Judging (J) trait â€“ INFJs 
 are not idle dreamers, but people capable of taking concrete steps 
 to realize their goals and make a lasting positive impact.
