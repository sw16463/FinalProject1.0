INFP personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good 
in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things 
better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, INFPs have
an inner flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the 
population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the INFP 
personality type - but when they find like-minded people to spend their time with,
the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration.

INFP personalityBeing a part of the Diplomat (NF) personality group, INFPs are guided
by their principles, rather than by logic (Analysts), excitement (Explorers), or practicality
(Sentinels). When deciding how to move forward, they will look to honor, beauty, morality and 
virtue - INFPs are led by the purity of their intent, not rewards and punishments. People who
share the INFP personality type are proud of this quality, and rightly so, but not everyone 
understands the drive behind these feelings, and it can lead to isolation.
