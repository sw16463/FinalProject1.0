The INTP personality type is fairly rare, making up only three percent of the population,
which is definitely a good thing for them, as there's nothing they'd be more unhappy 
about than being "common". INTPs pride themselves on their inventiveness and creativity,
their unique perspective and vigorous intellect. Usually known as the philosopher, the architect, 
or the dreamy professor, sINTPs have been responsible for many scientific discoveries throughout history.
