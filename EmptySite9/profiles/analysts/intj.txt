It's lonely at the top, and being one of the rarest and most strategically capable 
personality types, INTJs know this all too well. INTJs form just two percent of the 
population, and women of this personality type are especially rare, forming just 
0.8% of the population - it is often a challenge for them to find like-minded individuals 
who are able to keep up with their relentless intellectualism and chess-like maneuvering. 
People with the INTJ personality type are imaginative yet decisive, 
ambitious yet private, amazingly curious, but they do not squander their energy.
