ENTJs are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody 
the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that
draws crowds together behind a common goal. But unlike their Feeling (F) 
counterpart, ENTJs are characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, 
using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they've
 set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of 
the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality 
types that make up much of the rest of the world - but we have ENTJs to thank
for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.
