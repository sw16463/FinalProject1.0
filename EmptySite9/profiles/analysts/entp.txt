The ENTP personality type is the ultimate devil's advocate, thriving on the
process of shredding arguments and beliefs and letting the ribbons drift 
in the wind for all to see. Unlike their more determined Judging (J) counterparts,
ENTPs don't do this because they are trying to achieve some deeper purpose or 
strategic goal, but for the simple reason that it's fun. No one loves the process 
of mental sparring more than ENTPs, as it gives them a chance to exercise their 
effortlessly quick wit, broad accumulated knowledge base, and capacity for
connecting disparate ideas to prove their points.
