ISTPs love to explore with their hands and their eyes,
touching and examining the world around them with cool 
rationalism and spirited curiosity. ISTPs are natural Makers,
moving from project to project, building the useful and the 
superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment
as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, ISTPs find no greater
joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and 
putting them back together, just a little bit better than they were before.
