ESTP personality types always have an impact on their immediate 
surroundings – the best way to spot them at a crowded party is to 
look for the whirling eddy of people flitting about them as they 
move from group to group. Laughing and entertaining with an expressive
and often blunt and earthy humor, ESTPs love to have a good time and 
be the center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come on
stage at a show, it’ll be ESTPs volunteering – or at least volunteering
a shy friend.
