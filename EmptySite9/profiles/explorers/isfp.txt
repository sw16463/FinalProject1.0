ISFP personality types are true artists. This doesn’t necessarily 
apply in the typical sense, in which they are out painting happy 
little trees, though often enough they are perfectly capable of this.
Rather, it’s that they use aesthetics, design and even their choices
and actions to push the limits of social convention. ISFPs enjoy upsetting 
traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and behavior – 
chances are, they’ve expressed more than once the phrase “Don’t box me in!”
