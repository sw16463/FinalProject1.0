If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is 
the ESFP personality type. ESFPs get caught up in the excitement of the moment,
and want everyone else to feel that way, too. No other personality type is as 
generous with their time and energy as ESFPs when it comes to encouraging 
others, and no other personality type does it with such irresistible style.
