The ISFJ personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities 
defy the definition of their individual traits. Though possessing the
Feeling (F) trait, ISFJs have excellent analytical abilities; though 
Introverted (I), they have well-developed people skills and robust social 
relationships; and though they are a Judging (J) type, ISFJs are often 
receptive to change and new ideas. As with so many things, people with
the ISFJ personality type are more than the sum of their parts, 
and it is the way they use these strengths that defines who they are.
