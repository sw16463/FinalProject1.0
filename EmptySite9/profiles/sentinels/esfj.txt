People who share the ESFJ personality type are, for lack of a better word,
popular - which makes sense, given that it is also a very common personality
type, making up twelve percent of the population. In high school, ESFJs are 
the cheerleaders and the quarterbacks, setting the tone, taking the spotlight 
and leading their teams forward to victory and fame. Later in life, ESFJs 
continue to enjoy supporting their friends and loved ones, 
organizing social gatherings and doing their best to make sure everyone is happy.
